      <description>A flexible, project-centered setup for data science Switch between projects with a keystroke and do not worry about switching build systems. Expedite your data science workflow with this project-centered setup.
In this tutorial you will learn how to link Sublime Text 3 to an environment from Anaconda/Miniconda and execute Python with SublimeREPL. You might already have existing projects with different conda virtual environments - no worries. This setup can be easily applied to any project that you already have.</description>

      <description>Disclaimer This guide aims to be a great resource for practitioners of causal forest and wants to empower researchers with this awesome method. Whether you are a researcher keen to throw your data on causal forest or just want to have a glance for the next study, this article is for you.
I found myself diving into its source code, published papers on its theory and referring to its algorithm reference.</description>

      <description>Alternative ESG data sourcing from Google Trends and Yahoo! Finance API Capstone project for the data engineer nanodegree at Udacity The project centers around a fictitious firm called Green Quant that provides data about a firm&amp;rsquo;s sustainability profile. It combines both worlds from alternative indicators such as historical search interest from Google Trends and classical financial metrics taken from Yahoo! Finance. This showcases my skills in applying a broad range of tools like Apache Airflow, AWS EMR and Apache Spark.</description>

      <title>Run Apache Airflow on Windows 10</title>

      <description>Run Apache Airflow on Windows 10 Apache Airflow is a great tool to manage and schedule all steps of a data pipeline. However, running it on Windows 10 can be challenging. Airflow&amp;rsquo;s official Quick Start suggests a smooth start, but solely for Linux users. What about us Windows 10 people if we want to avoid Docker? These steps worked for me and hopefully will work for you, too.

      <description>Machine Learning in Python: Main developments and technology trends - Some thoughts on Nolet et al. (2020) Here, I briefly talk about the paper by Nolet, Patterson and Raschka (2020) &amp;ldquo;Machine Learning in Python: Main developments and technology trends in data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.&amp;rdquo;
If you are interested in Python and machine learning, the paper is a good read. It gives an historical account of why Python became a go-to language for ML and is here to stay.</description>

      <title>Understand your data with principle component analysis (PCA) and discover underlying patterns</title>

      <description>Understand your data with principle component analysis (PCA) and discover underlying patterns - Enhanced data exploration that goes beyond descriptives Save time, resources and stay healthy with data exploration that goes beyond means, distributions and correlations: Leverage PCA to see through the surface of variables. It saves time and resources, because it uncovers data issues before an hour-long model training and is good for a programmer&amp;rsquo;s health, since she trades off data worries with something more enjoyable.</description>

      <title>Predicting ESG risks with Pytorch, Google Trends and Amazon SageMaker</title>

      <description>Predicting ESG risks with Pytorch, Google Trends and Amazon SageMaker Introduction The project deals with a prediction task within finance, and in particular, sustainable investment. Private investors increasingly demand firms that act socially responsible, environmentally friendly and have good governance. The UN and leading asset management firms developed the three pillars of ESG, namely environmental, social and governmental, in a conference in 2005 (International Finance Corporation et al., 2005).
A few years ago investors were willing to accept lower returns for socially responsible investments, but firms with higher ESG scores closed the gap.</description>
